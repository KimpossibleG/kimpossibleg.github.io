				<h3>JavaScript, the Popular. Why do we love thee?</h3>
				<p>I've been asked why JavaScript is so darn popular.</p>
				<p>My answer? ... "JavaScript is popular?!"</p>
				<p>This whole JavaScript thing is pretty new news to me, but now that I'm working on becoming a fancy coder-pants, I suppose it's good to know the answer. In fact, it's probably good to know what the eff it is.</p>
				<p>So.</p>
				<p>Umm... :-)</p>
				<p>JavaScript is a <strong>programming</strong> language. We use it to make <strong>programs</strong>. Right? Right. But, more fundamentally, it makes web pages more dynamic. So, is it a replacement for HTML (which is the language we use to make webpages look like webpages instead of like pages of code)? No, sirree. HTML is still the essence and building blocks of webpages; JavaScript makes it do stuff. An analogy? HTML is like printed song lyrics; JavaScript is what takes those lyrics and turns them into a karaoke video. Before JavaScript, HTML just sat around on the web and looked pretty. With the addition of JavaScript, links now change colors when you hover over them. Pictures can scroll. You can click on a button or an image and it will change. That, my friends, is because of our good pal JavaScript.</p>
				<p>What's not to love? Back in the days of Netscape, who created JavaScript, JavaScript and the interwebs were like drunk freshman at a party: alllllll over each other, and confident that it was true love! Then, (dum dum dummmmmm!), along came some better looking kids who may have even been sober and interesting and just plain better, like Shell, PHP, Perl, and Ruby. Still, JavaScript has become and remains the absolute most popular web dev language out there. <strong>What gives?</strong></p>
				<p>Ubiquity: That's what gives. All the main browsers out there support JavaScript. As well, the libraries and extra tag-along bits and pieces that go along with JavaScript have become HUGE -- which is akin to a fully, incredibly, mesmerizingly well stocked kitchen to someone advised to make a meal. If all you have is carrots and potatoes, a pot, and a hotplate, there's a good chance you're having boiled carrots and potatoes, The End. In a kitchen with every imaginable slicer, dicer, ingredient, spice, utensil, and thinga-ma-jig, a gourmet spread is possible. Who doesn't want a gourmet website instead of carrots and potatoes?</p>
				<p>Add to all of this that JavaScript is relatively easy to learn, plays well with DOM, and processes on the client side, and we have a winner. The interwebs has a winner. And that, my friends, is why JavaScript is the most popular girl at the party.</p>

				<h3>Exploring My Values</h3>
				<p>Three times in my life when I recall being my absolute happiest, most satisfied, and proudest include my wedding day, watching my young daughter on her first carnival ride, and wrapping up a speech at a conference. The values that come to mind when reflecting on these occasions have quite a bit of overlap:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships</li>
					<li>Confidence</li>
					<li>Excitement</li>
					<li>Introspection</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The value of those that is particularly important to me is <strong>Introspection</strong>. I think that a false happiness is easily achieved, perhaps through adrenalin or celebration, or the use of drink or drugs. When introspection is involved, however -- when one can look inside and feel, understand, accept, and truly believe that the right choices are being made, that growth is happening, or that something is genuinely beautiful to you -- THAT'S when true happiness and satisfaction is possible.</p>
				<p>On a scale of 1-5 where 1 means Disagree and 5 means Agree, this is how much I try to live up to these values:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships: 5</li>
					<li>Confidence: 4</li>
					<li>Excitement: 4</li>
					<li>Introspection: 5</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm: 4</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Close relationships and introspection are two of the most important elements of who I am and how I live my life. While I appreciate confidence, excitement, and enthusiasm, I feel that confidence and excitement are more the result of what I'm doing than values, and that enthusiasm is a value that I must consciously apply whenever appropriate.</p>
				<p>The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was parenting -- specifically, how and when to go about having a toddler give up her pacifier. I've been a parent for almost four years, and it's been an ongoing shock to me that I'm actually pretty decent at it. I never thought I'd have the magical parenting touch. The fact that my friends ask me for advice on various elements of parenting -- and then often go on to accept and apply the advice -- makes my heart grow six sizes every time. I suppose that makes sense: Turns out that I value close relationships and introspection, which is a lot of what parenting is all about!</p>

				<h3>Three Websites</h3>
				<p>The three websites I assessed for this article are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href=http://thebloggess.com/>thebloggess.com</a></li>
					<li><a href=http://news.google.com/>news.google.com</a></li>
					<li><a href=http://www.buzzfeed.com/>buzzfeed.com</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h4><p>Let's start with The Bloggess.</p></h4>
				<p>This is one of my favorite sites simply because I enjoy the author's humour. She's irreverent, honest, funny, and a little nuts -- kind of like me, in some regards!</p>
				<p>As much as I'm not a fan of the color pink, I like the theme of this website. I find that the right things pop out at me -- the article titles, for example. The opening image in the header is both memorable and unique. What I <strong>don't</strong> like about this page is its flow between articles. When I read blogs, I tend to catch up on weeks or days worth of entries all at once, and it's important to me that I can do so fluidly. In this blog, I have to dig back several articles using the Previous link, read my way forward, working from the bottom of the page up. This makes me more insane than I find enjoyable.</p>
				<p>The author of this blog has quite a bit of stuff for sale, and I've not bought any. I have, however, been entertained by it. I've also purchased her book, but I did so at a real-life bookstore. I bought it there because I wanted it in a hurry and didn't want to wait for shipping.</p>

				<p><h4>The next site I looked at was news.google.com.</h4> I spend quite a bit of time on this site, and I've developed definite preferences for which device I use to read it. My smartphone and laptop are definitely winning out over my tablet. I think I enjoy the smartphone version because it contains only the bare necessities for reading through it, including simple arrows to access more articles/content, and a very limited number of articles per section (3). There is quite a bit more clutter on the laptop version, but I'm okay with that, because I have the bigger screen and can scroll quickly. The tablet, however, has combined the worst elements, in my opinion. Instaed of simple arrows to expand, there is an 'expand content' button that opens up to a bunch of different sources and articles, instead of a nice, compact list. As well, the tablet version shows me most popular and trending articles on the bottom right, and then suggestions by news source on the bottom right, and I have to scroll by news source. This is, for me, both irritating and a waste of time.</p>
				<p>I feel like my time on this site is well-spent, because I'm (supposedly) learning about the world and things that ought to make me a better-versed, more well-rounded person. Doesn't feel quite so awesome when I catch myself reading about Bieber and Rob Ford -- AGAIN.</p>

				<p><h4>Buzzfeed...</h4>...is what I turn to when I need to pass some time and I've read all the news and finished checking facebook. ;-) Buzzfeed is typically a total waste of time, and I feel like I need to wash after reading it. I usually view it on my phone or tablet, and the navigation is dreadful... After reading any of the articles, paging back brings me back to the top of the buzzfeed list o' crap, and I have to scroll allllllll the way down to find new content. This really ought to discourage me from continuing to read. It doesn't. That adds to my feeling that I am wasting my life.</p>
