            <h2>Paired Programming</h2>
            <p>Paired programming is when two coders work together on a single project simultaneously. One "drives" (with the keyboard) and the other "navigates" (tells the driver what to do). Two brains; one project.</p>
            <p>DBC emphasizes paired programming to help us develop empathy, catch errors, pick up other people's styles and strategies, get to know people, stay focussed, and because it's popular in the industry - so we should be exposed to it.</p>
            <p>We both felt a little funny doing the paired programming, but felt like it would get easier with practice. We each found being the driver easier than being the navigator -- perhaps there is just more pressure in that role, at least until we get to know each other better! Interestingly, both of us perceived that parts of it went slowly, and yet we were both impressed with what we were able to accomplish together during the short pairing session.</p>
