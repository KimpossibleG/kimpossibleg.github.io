				<h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
				<p>I really enjoy working with other people -- particularly smart, inventive, awesome people, like the ones that I have met "live" thus far in Dev Bootcamp: Big shout-outs to <a href="http://catherinev.github.io/index.html">Catherine</a>, <a href="http://bontgoy.github.io/index.html">Tyler</a>, <a href="http://xanderglassman.github.io/index.html">Xander</a>, and <a href="http://mikeepourhadi.github.io/index.html">Mikee</a>! You guys rock!</p>
				<p>Annnnnd, I hate pairing. I loathe it. I feel like a useless knob when I am acting as somebody else's fingers (aka being the Driver) and I feel stressed, rushed, and incompetent as the Navigator. It's a real struggle for me to be learning in either case. I feel that the uber-structured format of pairing is extremely limiting and hinders creativity and helpful conversation. It has been in the cases where my pair and I stray from the offical model and actually talk to each other and throw ideas around that I feel like we're both really benefitting -- and then we lose that momentum when we slip back into who is going to be driving and who is going to be navigating. Perhaps pairing will be more comfortable and productive when I know my pair well, know his/her level of skills and how it compares to my own, know his/her idiosyncracies, etc.</p>
				<p>The peer feedback that I've received on my coding and challenges thus far has been of excellent quality. It has consistently been specific, actionable, and kind -- and really helpful. I feel great getting the feedback!</p>
				<p>I haven't received any written feedback via the Feedbackinator yet, so I can't comment on how it will feel to get anonymous feedback. I have noticed, however, that the biggest gap in giving feedback (based on all the comments that I have read and rated) is when it comes to giving Actionable points. Everyone seems to quick to tell each other how fabulous they are, or how much they enjoyed the pairing session, but very few seem to provide suggestions for improvement. I find that disappointing.</p>
				<p>I am looking forward to getting some feedback from DBC staff, and confess that I am surprised that I haven't received any yet -- at least not that I know of! I know that I can get my code to pass tests, but I think that is only half the battle. Does my work indicate that I am 'getting it,' or am I relying on band-aids and workarounds too much? Is my pseudocode strong, and would it be helpful/appropriate for a work environment? I've been veering from the reflections guidelines and focussing on what is most helpful for myself. Am I still gaining from the exercise in the way that DBC intended?</p>
				<p>Writing feedback has been pretty painless. I do find that I am a bit wordy, but I don't think that negatively impacts the effectiveness of my messages. I do make an effort to be specific, actionable, and kind -- and it's great to have those guidelines in place.</p>

				<h3>Exploring My Values</h3>
				<p>Three times in my life when I recall being my absolute happiest, most satisfied, and proudest include my wedding day, watching my young daughter on her first carnival ride, and wrapping up a speech at a conference. The values that come to mind when reflecting on these occasions have quite a bit of overlap:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships</li>
					<li>Confidence</li>
					<li>Excitement</li>
					<li>Introspection</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The value of those that is particularly important to me is <strong>Introspection</strong>. I think that a false happiness is easily achieved, perhaps through adrenalin or celebration, or the use of drink or drugs. When introspection is involved, however -- when one can look inside and feel, understand, accept, and truly believe that the right choices are being made, that growth is happening, or that something is genuinely beautiful to you -- THAT'S when true happiness and satisfaction is possible.</p>
				<p>On a scale of 1-5 where 1 means Disagree and 5 means Agree, this is how much I try to live up to these values:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships: 5</li>
					<li>Confidence: 4</li>
					<li>Excitement: 4</li>
					<li>Introspection: 5</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm: 4</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Close relationships and introspection are two of the most important elements of who I am and how I live my life. While I appreciate confidence, excitement, and enthusiasm, I feel that confidence and excitement are more the result of what I'm doing than values, and that enthusiasm is a value that I must consciously apply whenever appropriate.</p>
				<p>The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was parenting -- specifically, how and when to go about having a toddler give up her pacifier. I've been a parent for almost four years, and it's been an ongoing shock to me that I'm actually pretty decent at it. I never thought I'd have the magical parenting touch. The fact that my friends ask me for advice on various elements of parenting -- and then often go on to accept and apply the advice -- makes my heart grow six sizes every time. I suppose that makes sense: Turns out that I value close relationships and introspection, which is a lot of what parenting is all about!</p>
