				<h3>Values vs. StereoType Threat: The DBC Showdown</h3>
				<p>I pulled this list of tactics to reduce stereotype threat from <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">www.reducingstereotypethreat.org</a>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Refaming the task</li>
					<li>Deemphasizing threatened social identities</li>
					<li>Encouraging self-affirmation</li>
					<li>Emphasing high standards with assurances about capabilities for meeting them</li>
					<li>Providing role models</li>
					<li>Providing external attributions for difficulty</li>
					<li>Emphasizing an incremental view of intelligence</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Almost all of those are things very much in my control. The key to all of that, however, is closely related to one of my most important personal values: introspection. Since spending some time learning mindfulness techniques in 2006, they have become a habitual, inextricable part of my moment-to-moment existence. I listen to my own thoughts as closely as possible, as if they are an audio book playing during every moment of my consciousness. As soon as I catch my brain telling me something negative -- that I suck, am incapable, can't do something, as examples -- I talk back to the audio track. "I'm pretty awesome, actually. I can nail this." ... Sound cheesy? Well, get this: the ability to do this naturally is one of the fundamental differences between persons who have spectacular mental health, and those who struggle with anxiety and depression. It's a subset of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a gold standard for a huge element of clinical psychology.</p>
				<p>My other main values will also contribute heavily to much success at DBC: Close relationships, confidence, excitement, and enthusiasm. I'll need close relationships in two places: at DBC within Chicago, and with my family and friends back home -- ESPECIALLY my family. Remember those spawn I mentioned? That amazing husband? This will be, by far, the longest I have been away from any of them since we met. I love these people, and my husband is my best friend. I NEED to stay emotionally close with them from afar. Big group project, tight deadlines? I still need to step away to connect with my family. Do my husband or kids need me? They win my time and attention, no contest. This is absolutely non-negotiable for me.</p>
				<p>Excitement, enthusiasm, confidence? They're all interrelated for me. I need to make sure that the projects I am working on are personally relevant and interesting for me. Stress also can't get in the way of laughter, and maintaining positive energy is a must. Sounds like we have a great group heading to Chicago, so it shouldn't a problem. :-)</p>

				<h3>StereoNonTypical</h3>
				<p><em>"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group..."</em> (Source: <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">www.reducingstereotypethreat.org</a>)</p>
				<p>Stereotypically, I've got three strikes against me before I even step up to the plate. Ready for this trifecta?</p>
				<p>I am a <strong><em>crazy... old... woman.</em></strong></p>
				<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
				<p>Let's <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=crazy+old+woman">google</a> that shiznat, shall we?!</p>
				<p><img class=blog_image src=images/crazy_old_woman.png></p>
				<p>Yep. Looking good, Girard. Looking goooooooooooooooood. O_o</p>
				<p>Let's take a look at how this makes me feel going into DBC. I submit, for your consideration, Exhibit A, from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/faq/">devbootcamp.com/faq</a>: Women in web dev? Women? Women, where are you?!</p>
				<p><img class=blog_image src=images/female_scholarship.png></p>
				<p><img class=blog_image src=images/levo_scholars.png></p>
				<p>This says to me, "You face extra obstacles in this field. This will be harder for you. We think you can break into the club, ladies. C'mon - let's prove it. PROOOOOOOVE IT."</p>
				<p>Heavens to Grundo! C'mon, vagina! Get coding!</p>
				<p>Exhibit B, from the same page?</p>
				<p><img class=blog_image src=images/over_40.png></p>
				<p>"Should I even apply, given that I have one foot in the grave?"</p>
				<p>I hear the answer loud and clear -- "Yes, yes, of course you should! We're not ageist! It'll be tougher, but we know you can do this! Prove it! PROOOOOOOOVE IT!"</p>
				<p>And the third strike? In the wise, poetic words of Allen Ginsberg, "I'm crazy as a daisy." I have bipolar disorder, type I, with psychosis. This is the first image that came up when I googled the word 'bipolar':</p>
				<p><img class=blog_image src=images/bipolar.jpg></p>
				<p>So, I don't know if you've heard the rumours or not, but people in this particular group are supposed to fail at life in general. Bit of a buzzkill, huh?</p>
				<p>So.</p>
				<p>Here's the fun news: I am totally not worried about this. Any of it. I'm sure there are some fascinating sociopsychological reasons why women haven't historically been equally represented in tech, but they're not <em>my</em> reasons or <em>my</em> obstacles. Old? <em>Old?</em> Since when has a well-curated resume and a pretty long list of incredible, solidifying life experiences ever slowed anyone down? And the bipolar disorder?? It's a gift, carefully managed, that I fret about less often than the inevitable zombie apocolypse. In other words, it's FINE.</p>
				<p>If I were to need to link this to some sort of scientific phenomenon, though, I'd probably lean on this little nugget that I found  on <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">www.reducingstereotypethreat.org</a>: <em>"...research also demonstrates that within a stereotyped group, some members may be more vulnerable to its negative consequences than others; factors such as the strength of one's group identification or domain identification have been shown to be related to one's subsequent vulnerability to stereotype threat."</em> That's me, team. Yes, I am a woman, born in the 70s, with a diagnosed mental illness... but that's not WHO I AM. I'm me. I'm Kim. And I have nothing to prove, to myself or anyone else.</p>
				<p>From where I sit, there's a lot more freedom than threat in that.</p>

<!--In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public? -->

				<h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
				<p>I really enjoy working with other people -- particularly smart, inventive, awesome people, like the ones that I have met "live" thus far in Dev Bootcamp: Big shout-outs to <a href="http://catherinev.github.io/index.html">Catherine</a>, <a href="http://bontgoy.github.io/index.html">Tyler</a>, <a href="http://xanderglassman.github.io/index.html">Xander</a>, and <a href="http://mikeepourhadi.github.io/index.html">Mikee</a>! You guys rock!</p>
				<p>Annnnnd, I hate pairing. I loathe it. I feel like a useless knob when I am acting as somebody else's fingers (aka being the Driver) and I feel stressed, rushed, and incompetent as the Navigator. It's a real struggle for me to be learning in either case. I feel that the uber-structured format of pairing is extremely limiting and hinders creativity and helpful conversation. It has been in the cases where my pair and I stray from the offical model and actually talk to each other and throw ideas around that I feel like we're both really benefitting -- and then we lose that momentum when we slip back into who is going to be driving and who is going to be navigating. Perhaps pairing will be more comfortable and productive when I know my pair well, know his/her level of skills and how it compares to my own, know his/her idiosyncracies, etc.</p>
				<p>The peer feedback that I've received on my coding and challenges thus far has been of excellent quality. It has consistently been specific, actionable, and kind -- and really helpful. I feel great getting the feedback!</p>
				<p>I haven't received any written feedback via the Feedbackinator yet, so I can't comment on how it will feel to get anonymous feedback. I have noticed, however, that the biggest gap in giving feedback (based on all the comments that I have read and rated) is when it comes to giving Actionable points. Everyone seems to quick to tell each other how fabulous they are, or how much they enjoyed the pairing session, but very few seem to provide suggestions for improvement. I find that disappointing.</p>
				<p>I am looking forward to getting some feedback from DBC staff, and confess that I am surprised that I haven't received any yet -- at least not that I know of! I know that I can get my code to pass tests, but I think that is only half the battle. Does my work indicate that I am 'getting it,' or am I relying on band-aids and workarounds too much? Is my pseudocode strong, and would it be helpful/appropriate for a work environment? I've been veering from the reflections guidelines and focussing on what is most helpful for myself. Am I still gaining from the exercise in the way that DBC intended?</p>
				<p>Writing feedback has been pretty painless. I do find that I am a bit wordy, but I don't think that negatively impacts the effectiveness of my messages. I do make an effort to be specific, actionable, and kind -- and it's great to have those guidelines in place.</p>

				<h3>Exploring My Values</h3>
				<p>Three times in my life when I recall being my absolute happiest, most satisfied, and proudest include my wedding day, watching my young daughter on her first carnival ride, and wrapping up a speech at a conference. The values that come to mind when reflecting on these occasions have quite a bit of overlap:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships</li>
					<li>Confidence</li>
					<li>Excitement</li>
					<li>Introspection</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The value of those that is particularly important to me is <strong>Introspection</strong>. I think that a false happiness is easily achieved, perhaps through adrenalin or celebration, or the use of drink or drugs. When introspection is involved, however -- when one can look inside and feel, understand, accept, and truly believe that the right choices are being made, that growth is happening, or that something is genuinely beautiful to you -- THAT'S when true happiness and satisfaction is possible.</p>
				<p>On a scale of 1-5 where 1 means Disagree and 5 means Agree, this is how much I try to live up to these values:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships: 5</li>
					<li>Confidence: 4</li>
					<li>Excitement: 4</li>
					<li>Introspection: 5</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm: 4</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Close relationships and introspection are two of the most important elements of who I am and how I live my life. While I appreciate confidence, excitement, and enthusiasm, I feel that confidence and excitement are more the result of what I'm doing than values, and that enthusiasm is a value that I must consciously apply whenever appropriate.</p>
				<p>The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was parenting -- specifically, how and when to go about having a toddler give up her pacifier. I've been a parent for almost four years, and it's been an ongoing shock to me that I'm actually pretty decent at it. I never thought I'd have the magical parenting touch. The fact that my friends ask me for advice on various elements of parenting -- and then often go on to accept and apply the advice -- makes my heart grow six sizes every time. I suppose that makes sense: Turns out that I value close relationships and introspection, which is a lot of what parenting is all about!</p>
