				<h3 id="entry1">Three Websites</h3>
				<p>The three websites I assessed for this article are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href=http://thebloggess.com/>thebloggess.com</a></li>
				<li><a href=http://news.google.com/>news.google.com</a></li>
				<li><a href=http://www.buzzfeed.com/>buzzfeed.com</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3><p>Let's start with The Bloggess.</p></h3>
			<p>This is one of my favorite sites simply because I enjoy the author's humour. She's irreverent, honest, funny, and a little nuts -- kind of like me, in some regards!</p>
			<p>As much as I'm not a fan of the color pink, I like the theme of this website. I find that the right things pop out at me -- the article titles, for example. The opening image in the header is both memorable and unique. What I <strong>don't</strong> like about this page is its flow between articles. When I read blogs, I tend to catch up on weeks or days worth of entries all at once, and it's important to me that I can do so fluidly. In this blog, I have to dig back several articles using the Previous link, read my way forward, working from the bottom of the page up. This makes me more insane than I find enjoyable.</p>
			<p>The author of this blog has quite a bit of stuff for sale, and I've not bought any. I have, however, been entertained by it. I've also purchased her book, but I did so at a real-life bookstore. I bought it there because I wanted it in a hurry and didn't want to wait for shipping.</p>

			<p><h3>The next site I looked at was news.google.com.</h3> I spend quite a bit of time on this site, and I've developed definite preferences for which device I use to read it. My smartphone and laptop are definitely winning out over my tablet. I think I enjoy the smartphone version because it contains only the bare necessities for reading through it, including simple arrows to access more articles/content, and a very limited number of articles per section (3). There is quite a bit more clutter on the laptop version, but I'm okay with that, because I have the bigger screen and can scroll quickly. The tablet, however, has combined the worst elements, in my opinion. Instaed of simple arrows to expand, there is an 'expand content' button that opens up to a bunch of different sources and articles, instead of a nice, compact list. As well, the tablet version shows me most popular and trending articles on the bottom right, and then suggestions by news source on the bottom right, and I have to scroll by news source. This is, for me, both irritating and a waste of time.</p>
			<p>I feel like my time on this site is well-spent, because I'm (supposedly) learning about the world and things that ought to make me a better-versed, more well-rounded person. Doesn't feel quite so awesome when I catch myself reading about Bieber and Rob Ford -- AGAIN.</p>

			<p><h3>Buzzfeed...</h3>...is what I turn to when I need to pass some time and I've read all the news and finished checking facebook. ;-) Buzzfeed is typically a total waste of time, and I feel like I need to wash after reading it. I usually view it on my phone or tablet, and the navigation is dreadful... After reading any of the articles, paging back brings me back to the top of the buzzfeed list o' crap, and I have to scroll allllllll the way down to find new content. This really ought to discourage me from continuing to read. It doesn't. That adds to my feeling that I am wasting my life.</p>
