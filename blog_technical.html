				<h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
				<p>I really enjoy working with other people -- particularly smart, inventive, awesome people, like the ones that I have met "live" thus far in Dev Bootcamp: Big shout-outs to <a href="http://catherinev.github.io/index.html">Catherine</a>, <a href="http://bontgoy.github.io/index.html">Tyler</a>, <a href="http://xanderglassman.github.io/index.html">Xander</a>, and <a href="http://mikeepourhadi.github.io/index.html">Mikee</a>! You guys rock!</p>
				<p>Annnnnd, I hate pairing. I loathe it. I feel like a useless knob when I am acting as somebody else's fingers (aka being the Driver) and I feel stressed, rushed, and incompetent as the Navigator. It's a real struggle for me to be learning in either case. I feel that the uber-structured format of pairing is extremely limiting and hinders creativity and helpful conversation. It has been in the cases where my pair and I stray from the offical model and actually talk to each other and throw ideas around that I feel like we're both really benefitting -- and then we lose that momentum when we slip back into who is going to be driving and who is going to be navigating. Perhaps pairing will be more comfortable and productive when I know my pair well, know his/her level of skills and how it compares to my own, know his/her idiosyncracies, etc.</p>
				<p>The peer feedback that I've received on my coding and challenges thus far has been of excellent quality. It has consistently been specific, actionable, and kind -- and really helpful. I feel great getting the feedback!</p>
				<p>I haven't received any written feedback via the Feedbackinator yet, so I can't comment on how it will feel to get anonymous feedback. I have noticed, however, that the biggest gap in giving feedback (based on all the comments that I have read and rated) is when it comes to giving Actionable points. Everyone seems to quick to tell each other how fabulous they are, or how much they enjoyed the pairing session, but very few seem to provide suggestions for improvement. I find that disappointing.</p>
				<p>I am looking forward to getting some feedback from DBC staff, and confess that I am surprised that I haven't received any yet -- at least not that I know of! I know that I can get my code to pass tests, but I think that is only half the battle. Does my work indicate that I am 'getting it,' or am I relying on band-aids and workarounds too much? Is my pseudocode strong, and would it be helpful/appropriate for a work environment? I've been veering from the reflections guidelines and focussing on what is most helpful for myself. Am I still gaining from the exercise in the way that DBC intended?</p>
				<p>Writing feedback has been pretty painless. I do find that I am a bit wordy, but I don't think that negatively impacts the effectiveness of my messages. I do make an effort to be specific, actionable, and kind -- and it's great to have those guidelines in place.</p>

				<h3>Exploring My Values</h3>
				<p>Three times in my life when I recall being my absolute happiest, most satisfied, and proudest include my wedding day, watching my young daughter on her first carnival ride, and wrapping up a speech at a conference. The values that come to mind when reflecting on these occasions have quite a bit of overlap:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships</li>
					<li>Confidence</li>
					<li>Excitement</li>
					<li>Introspection</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The value of those that is particularly important to me is <strong>Introspection</strong>. I think that a false happiness is easily achieved, perhaps through adrenalin or celebration, or the use of drink or drugs. When introspection is involved, however -- when one can look inside and feel, understand, accept, and truly believe that the right choices are being made, that growth is happening, or that something is genuinely beautiful to you -- THAT'S when true happiness and satisfaction is possible.</p>
				<p>On a scale of 1-5 where 1 means Disagree and 5 means Agree, this is how much I try to live up to these values:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Close relationships: 5</li>
					<li>Confidence: 4</li>
					<li>Excitement: 4</li>
					<li>Introspection: 5</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm: 4</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Close relationships and introspection are two of the most important elements of who I am and how I live my life. While I appreciate confidence, excitement, and enthusiasm, I feel that confidence and excitement are more the result of what I'm doing than values, and that enthusiasm is a value that I must consciously apply whenever appropriate.</p>
				<p>The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was parenting -- specifically, how and when to go about having a toddler give up her pacifier. I've been a parent for almost four years, and it's been an ongoing shock to me that I'm actually pretty decent at it. I never thought I'd have the magical parenting touch. The fact that my friends ask me for advice on various elements of parenting -- and then often go on to accept and apply the advice -- makes my heart grow six sizes every time. I suppose that makes sense: Turns out that I value close relationships and introspection, which is a lot of what parenting is all about!</p>

				<h3>Three Websites</h3>
				<p>The three websites I assessed for this article are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href=http://thebloggess.com/>thebloggess.com</a></li>
					<li><a href=http://news.google.com/>news.google.com</a></li>
					<li><a href=http://www.buzzfeed.com/>buzzfeed.com</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h4><p>Let's start with The Bloggess.</p></h4>
				<p>This is one of my favorite sites simply because I enjoy the author's humour. She's irreverent, honest, funny, and a little nuts -- kind of like me, in some regards!</p>
				<p>As much as I'm not a fan of the color pink, I like the theme of this website. I find that the right things pop out at me -- the article titles, for example. The opening image in the header is both memorable and unique. What I <strong>don't</strong> like about this page is its flow between articles. When I read blogs, I tend to catch up on weeks or days worth of entries all at once, and it's important to me that I can do so fluidly. In this blog, I have to dig back several articles using the Previous link, read my way forward, working from the bottom of the page up. This makes me more insane than I find enjoyable.</p>
				<p>The author of this blog has quite a bit of stuff for sale, and I've not bought any. I have, however, been entertained by it. I've also purchased her book, but I did so at a real-life bookstore. I bought it there because I wanted it in a hurry and didn't want to wait for shipping.</p>

				<p><h4>The next site I looked at was news.google.com.</h4> I spend quite a bit of time on this site, and I've developed definite preferences for which device I use to read it. My smartphone and laptop are definitely winning out over my tablet. I think I enjoy the smartphone version because it contains only the bare necessities for reading through it, including simple arrows to access more articles/content, and a very limited number of articles per section (3). There is quite a bit more clutter on the laptop version, but I'm okay with that, because I have the bigger screen and can scroll quickly. The tablet, however, has combined the worst elements, in my opinion. Instaed of simple arrows to expand, there is an 'expand content' button that opens up to a bunch of different sources and articles, instead of a nice, compact list. As well, the tablet version shows me most popular and trending articles on the bottom right, and then suggestions by news source on the bottom right, and I have to scroll by news source. This is, for me, both irritating and a waste of time.</p>
				<p>I feel like my time on this site is well-spent, because I'm (supposedly) learning about the world and things that ought to make me a better-versed, more well-rounded person. Doesn't feel quite so awesome when I catch myself reading about Bieber and Rob Ford -- AGAIN.</p>

				<p><h4>Buzzfeed...</h4>...is what I turn to when I need to pass some time and I've read all the news and finished checking facebook. ;-) Buzzfeed is typically a total waste of time, and I feel like I need to wash after reading it. I usually view it on my phone or tablet, and the navigation is dreadful... After reading any of the articles, paging back brings me back to the top of the buzzfeed list o' crap, and I have to scroll allllllll the way down to find new content. This really ought to discourage me from continuing to read. It doesn't. That adds to my feeling that I am wasting my life.</p>
